# Hi there, I'm Furkan Berat Ay! 

I'm studying Statistics at Hunter College with minors in CS and Math, graduating in May 2027. I got into data science because I loved finding patterns in messy data—turns out you can actually build a career around that.

I've been lucky to work with some great companies. Right now I'm working as a machine learning engineer intern at International Elite Capital. Before this, I did data engineering at CVS Health, where I migrated workflows to the cloud and built quality checks that helped hundreds of engineers do their jobs better. I've also interned at Evergreen Investments building dashboards and automating reports, and at Data Glacier working on customer segmentation and predictive models. The technical work is fun, but what I really care about is making it useful—a perfect model means nothing if you can't explain what it does and why it matters.

I'm also in the Break Through Tech AI Program at Cornell Tech right now. It's a year-long deep dive into ML with Cornell professors and people from industry. Pretty intense but exactly what I was looking for. I'm also part of the Basta fellowship, which has been great for figuring out the whole career thing as a student.

Outside of data work, I run the Turkish Club and the Statistics Club at Hunter. For the Stats Club, we're actually planning a school-wide datathon for 50+ students. The Turkish Club organizes cultural events—honestly, both remind me that behind every dataset are actual people with stories. I speak Turkish, Azerbaijani, and English, which has been surprisingly helpful when working on international projects—you pick up on context that pure numbers miss.

When I'm not coding, I'm skating around the city, gaming with friends, or watching soccer. My dream is to eventually work as a data scientist for Fenerbahçe, my childhood club. Keeps me grounded and reminds me why I got into this field in the first place.

I'm looking for opportunities where I can do meaningful work with data and keep learning. If that sounds like a fit, let's talk.
