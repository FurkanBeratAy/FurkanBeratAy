# Hi there, I'm Furkan Berat Ay! 👋

## 🎓 About Me

I'm a passionate data scientist and machine learning enthusiast currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics at Hunter College, with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. Expected to graduate in May 2027, I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between complex data and actionable business insights through the power of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics.

My journey in data science began with a fascination for uncovering hidden patterns in seemingly chaotic datasets. Over the past year, I've had the privilege of working with industry leaders like CVS Health, Evergreen Investments, and Data Glacier, where I've honed my skills in machine learning, data engineering, and predictive modeling. From processing millions of rows of data to building sophisticated ML models that drive real business value, I've consistently delivered measurable impact—whether it's reducing financial risk by $250K annually or boosting marketing ROI by 18%.

What sets me apart is my ability to translate complex statistical concepts into clear, executive-level insights. I believe that the most powerful algorithms are meaningless without the ability to communicate their findings effectively. This philosophy has guided my approach to every project, from customer segmentation analyses for Latin American banks to building automated data quality frameworks for Fortune 500 companies.

Currently, I'm one of only a select few chosen from 3,600+ applicants for the prestigious Break Through Tech AI Program at Cornell Tech, where I'm diving deep into cutting-edge machine learning techniques alongside industry professionals and Cornell faculty. This 12-month intensive program is further sharpening my expertise in AI foundations and practical applications.

Beyond the technical realm, I'm deeply committed to fostering community and cross-cultural understanding. As President of the Hunter College Turkish Club, I organize events and initiatives that celebrate diversity while building bridges between different communities. I believe that the best data scientists are those who understand the human element behind every dataset.

My multilingual abilities (Turkish, Azerbaijani, and English) have given me a unique perspective on global markets and cross-cultural data analysis, which has proven invaluable in my international project work. Whether I'm analyzing banking data from South America or building predictive models for North American markets, I bring a global mindset to every challenge.

**🏆 Academic Achievements:**
- Dean's List: Fall '23, Spring '24
- Roosevelt Scholar: 2023-2027
- Break Through Tech AI Fellow: Selected from 3,600+ applicants

**🎯 Current Focus Areas:**
- Advanced Machine Learning & AI
- Data Engineering at Scale
- Predictive Analytics & Business Intelligence
- Cross-Cultural Data Analysis
- Leadership in Tech Diversity

**🎮 When I'm Not Coding:**
When I step away from algorithms and datasets, you'll find me exploring the world beyond the screen. I'm passionate about skating—whether it's cruising through the city or perfecting new tricks at the local skate park. Gaming has always been a creative outlet for me, from strategy games that sharpen my analytical thinking to collaborative multiplayer experiences that build teamwork skills.

I believe in the importance of balance, so I love spending time outdoors—hiking, exploring new neighborhoods, or just enjoying nature's data patterns in a completely different way. Nothing beats hanging out with friends, sharing stories, and building the kind of authentic connections that remind me why human-centered design matters so much in data science.

These interests keep me grounded and fuel my creativity, often inspiring unique approaches to the technical challenges I tackle in my professional work.
